      <p>that closes the gap between cabled ground and networked sky. Upload is simple. 
      If you ever find yourself in doubt, fall back on that phrase. It will generally 
      bring you to the right place and help you to write the right thing. With that in 
      mind, we can allow ourselves to treat the upload as something technical, something 
      to write poems with. From the poet’s point of view, the upload is a work that 
      accomplishes basically two things: first, as with any computer network, the act 
      of uploading moves existing information from one system to another. Second, the 
      information it moves is real information, that is, it can be spoken. Taken together, 
      these three related concepts (move, info, real) make the upload. Combined in the poem, 
      they address conditions familiar to all readers and illuminate the direction of their 
      creative energy: up, outward, laden with packets of possibility. The poems that you 
      upload show us the cloud they connect to and do a little to close the gap between cabled 
      ground and networked sky.</p>
