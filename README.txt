 What is this?
<------------->

This project is a landing page for my online presence.
I want it to be simple and readable but also to point to some innovative or interesting ideas about what a landing page can be.

 What will it do?
<--------------->

It will primarily display a few links to my other pages with some really neat formatting.
That formatting might include some nifty animations--I really want to capture people's attention with this page.
I'm also investigating other Neocities pages to identify what sorts of things people add--chatboxes, guestbooks, etc. It might have some of those. But maybe not for the sake of simplicity.

 Can I help?
<----------->

No, but thanks for asking. This is a very personal project.

 Can I steal the code/markup?
<---------------------------->

Yes!! Emphatically yes. I do not own this and never will. A credit for inspiration is appreciated but not required. 
Theoretically this comes back to bite me but I really do want to be known on my own merit and not because a legal fiction protects my 'property'.

 Currently planned features
<-------------------------->
  
  * Eye-catching & effective visual links
  * Responsive mobile formatting 
  * Animations
  * Interactivity that goes beyond mere links
  * Ko-fi page (or some other formal support platform)
  * Guestbook & chatbox (maybe)
